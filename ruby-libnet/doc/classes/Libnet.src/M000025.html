 * Writes a prebuilt packet to the network. The function assumes that l was
 * previously initialized (via a call to libnet_init()) and that a
 * previously constructed packet has been built inside this context (via one or
 * more calls to the libnet_build* family of functions) and is ready to go.
 * Depending on how libnet was initialized, the function will write the packet
 * to the wire either via the raw or link layer interface. The function will
 * also bump up the internal libnet stat counters which are retrievable via
 * libnet_stats().
 *
 * * @return the number of bytes written, -1 on error

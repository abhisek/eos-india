[-- Trusted Path Execution for Linux Kernel --]

Q: When to deny execution?
A: Deny always. Allow only when:
      1) Executable is root owned and resides in root owned directory and the directory 
         is not writable by group and world and the environment is not malicious.

Q: Requirements?
A: Linux Kernel 2.6 branch compiled with CONFIG_SECURITY (LSM support)

Q: How to test?
A: Follow these steps as root to install and configure:
   make
   insmod ./kern-tpe.ko
   cat /proc/tpe/add
   echo "%100" > /proc/tpe/add (to allow all users in gid 100 to execute anything)
   echo "1000" > /proc/tpe/add (to allow only uid 1000 to execute everything)
   cat /proc/tpe/add (to view current trust list)
   * uid 0 always have full execution privilege

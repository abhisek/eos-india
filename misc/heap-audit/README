== Basic Framework ==

heaplib should act as a preloaded library into the address space of the process to be audited. It should record all malloc/realloc/free information and support easy addition of checks for possible heap corruption related bugs.

The basic modelling of this heap auditing framework is based on "stateful inspection" of memory allocation and program behaviour with dynamic memory management.
